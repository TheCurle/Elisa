# Elisa  
The Erythro Language Instruction Set Architecture, an Intermediary Language.  

The implementation of the Elisa system will be here, in branches;
 * interpreter
 * assembler
 * hardware

The information you need to implement the system yourself is in the wiki of this repository.  
That's where most of the work here is going to be.
